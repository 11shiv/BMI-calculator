# BMI Calculator

This project demonstrates how to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The application allows users to input their weight and height, then calculates and displays their BMI, along with a message indicating their BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).
